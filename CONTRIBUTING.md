### CONTRIBUTING TO OUR APP

We (this includes Bo) are happy you found our project and that you are interested in contributing.
Since this is our first bigger project, that combines scientific research with hands-on programming, we consider it as our little baby. We learned a lot, made a couple mistakes and learned even more from them.
Learning with others is even better, so if you have any interest in contributing, start by reading and following our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report any unacceptable behaviour to jegny100@gmail.com.

Soooo wanna contribute? The cool thing about this project is, that not only are you able to help us, you can also help each other! Here's how:

- Bug Reports  
One thing's for sure: people testing our project are waaay better at finding bugs than we are, as the programmers. So we are happy for any bug reports of issues that you have encountered. We are also very interested in feedback on our use of Git, programming style and so on, as this is our first major project.

- Feature Proposal (science-based)  
Please note, that this project is committed to scientific work. We based our app features on studies and a ton of research and that being said, any new feature proposal should include scientific sources that support your idea. If you have trouble finding foundations for your idea, consider issueing a 'Feature Idea (science based needed)' as described below

- Feature Idea (science based needed)  
This is the part where we help each other to contribute to this project. If you have any ideas for fun features, but are not able to find any science that supports or rejects your ideas, maybe someone else can? Or from the other perspective: Maybe you can find scientific sources that discuss a given feature idea?
Exchange your findings under the issue (always remember the Code of Conduct - Bo is watching you) and submit your results as a feature proposal. (Please note that ideas that are rejected are as important for us and the research as the supported ones!)

- Science Question  
As we already stated, research is a thing in this project. So if you have any questions about our theory section in our ReadMe or the sources we used, feel free to ask us!
